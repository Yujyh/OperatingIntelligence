## Abstract
Operating systems have historically been reactive platforms that wait for user commands and manage resources deterministically. We introduce **Operating Intelligence (OI)**, an OS‑integrated, proactive intelligence layer that anticipates needs, coordinates sensor and application ecosystems, and supports lifelong learning, health, and professional growth while preserving human agency. The manuscript presents a reference architecture, interaction primitives, governance proposals (including capability gating and AGI‑alignment practices), and an evaluation roadmap.
